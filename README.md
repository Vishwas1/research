# research
This repo is to maintain blogs/research works. From now onwards, what ever research we are doing realeted to Hypermine, 
please make a habit of creating a basic doc(readme). I know its a bit of more work along with researchs but trust 
me it is going to help us in the long run for sure. Please co-operate.

# Steps

- Clone the repo in local.
- Create a folder wrt to the technology realted for the blog. For ex. if research is on AWS topic, first check if there is any folder
already created to AWS or not, if not create a folder AWS.
- Once the folder is created, create a `.md` file. Name the file with name of the topic for ex. `ethereum-node-on-aws.md`.
- If your blog contains any image then first create a folder with the name of blog, put all realted images into it and then provide the link into your `.md` files.
- Create a new branch and check-in the code.
- Submit the PR
